# Mac Development Ansible Playbook

This playbook installs and configures most of the software used by Handpoint employees. This repo is a fork of [mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook)

This is a work in progress.

## Installation

  1. Ensure Apple's command line tools are installed (`xcode-select --install` to launch the installer).
  2. [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html).
  3. Clone this repository to your local drive.
  4. Run `$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` inside this directory to install required Ansible roles.
  5. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory --ask-become-pass` inside this directory. Enter your MacOS account password when prompted.

> Note: If some Homebrew commands fail, you might need to agree to Xcode's license or fix some other Brew issue. Run `brew doctor` to see if this is the case.

### Running a specific set of tagged tasks

You can filter which part of the provisioning process to run by specifying a set of tags using `ansible-playbook`'s `--tags` flag. The tags available are `dotfiles`, `homebrew`, `mas`, `extra-packages` and `osx`.

    ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory -K --tags "dotfiles,homebrew"

## Overriding Defaults

Not everyone's development environment and preferred software configuration is the same.

You can override any of the defaults configured in `default.config.yml` by creating a `config.yml` file and setting the overrides in that file. For example, you can customize the installed packages and apps with something like:

    homebrew_installed_packages:
      - cowsay
      - git
      - go
    
    mas_installed_apps:
      - { id: 443987910, name: "1Password" }
      - { id: 498486288, name: "Quick Resizer" }
      - { id: 557168941, name: "Tweetbot" }
      - { id: 497799835, name: "Xcode" }
    
    composer_packages:
      - name: hirak/prestissimo
      - name: drush/drush
        version: '^8.1'
    
    gem_packages:
      - name: bundler
        state: latest
    
    npm_packages:
      - name: webpack
    
    pip_packages:
      - name: mkdocs

Any variable can be overridden in `config.yml`; see the supporting roles' documentation for a complete list of available variables.
